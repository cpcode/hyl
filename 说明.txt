使用权限插件entrust
https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust

    In order to install Laravel 5 Entrust, just add the following to your composer.json. Then run composer update:

"zizaco/entrust": "5.2.x-dev"

    Open your config/app.php and add the following to the providers array:

Zizaco\Entrust\EntrustServiceProvider::class,

    In the same config/app.php and add the following to the aliases array:

'Entrust'   => Zizaco\Entrust\EntrustFacade::class,

    Run the command below to publish the package config file config/entrust.php:

php artisan vendor:publish

    Open your config/auth.php and add the following to it:

'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'eloquent',
        'model' => Namespace\Of\Your\User\Model\User::class,
        'table' => 'users',
    ],
],

    If you want to use Middleware (requires Laravel 5.1 or later) you also need to add the following:

    'role' => \Zizaco\Entrust\Middleware\EntrustRole::class,
    'permission' => \Zizaco\Entrust\Middleware\EntrustPermission::class,
    'ability' => \Zizaco\Entrust\Middleware\EntrustAbility::class,

to routeMiddleware array in app/Http/Kernel.php.
Configuration

Set the property values in the config/auth.php. These values will be used by entrust to refer to the correct user table and model.

To further customize table names and model namespaces, edit the config/entrust.php.
User relation to roles

Now generate the Entrust migration:

php artisan entrust:migration

It will generate the <timestamp>_entrust_setup_tables.php migration. You may now run it with the artisan migrate command:

php artisan migrate
